## Project proposal

We will be extracting “2017 American Community Survey” from Census.gov, and Health Data for 500 cities downloaded through Kaggle as an CSV file.

The Census data will be extracted through an API call.

The data will be joined by FIPS codes on location.

We will be using MySQL to create a database titled “Health_Community_DB.”

## Data Sources

- Kaggle Dataset: CDC 500 Cities Dozens of Public Health Datapoints Reported by Residents of 500 US Cities (https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/500-cities)

 - Census API (https://api.census.gov)



## Database and output

We will be using MySQL to create a database titled “Health_Community_DB”. The Census data will be extracted through an API call. The data will be joined by FIPS codes on location.
